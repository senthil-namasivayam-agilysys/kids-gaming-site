# FunZone: Kids Gaming Site

Welcome to FunZone, a playful and interactive gaming site for kids aged 10â€“15! This project is designed for learning, fun, and hands-on web development practice.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file, loads branding, theme, and games dynamically.
- `styles.css`: Uses CSS variables for easy theming.
- `scripts.js`: Loads JSON data and populates the site.
- `data/branding.json`: Organization branding (logo, colors, contact, social).
- `data/theme.json`: Color palette and font.
- `data/games.json`: Game list, tagline, and countdown.
- `assets/`: Images and icons.

## How Branding Works
- All branding and theme data is loaded from JSON files in `data/`.
- Update `branding.json` or `theme.json` to instantly change the look and feel.
- Social media, logo, and contact info are injected automatically.

## Learning Checkpoints
- Look for `<!-- TODO: student exercise -->` in the code for extension ideas.
- Try adding new games, changing the theme, or customizing the layout!

## Setup
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Use Live Server or open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Edit JSON files to see changes live.

Happy coding!
